# MAJOR LEARNINGS

1. Start AWS EC2 instance with KP-1.pem

2. ssh -i <path-to>.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>

3. Ensure IAM user has AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess

4. Create repo in AWS ECR and use the given push commands

5. Open AWS App Runner

First time => Run the following commands (For Amazon Linux)

sudo yum update -y  
sudo yum install git -y  
sudo yum install python3 -y  
sudo yum install make
sudo yum install docker -y  
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
python3 -m venv .venv
source ~/.venv/bin/activate # Add to ~/.bashrc file end
aws configure # Give info available in aws' config and credentials

We just started with a function.
We built up a tool, we built up a micro service, we containerized it.
We pushed the containerized micro service into a docker container registry.
And now we can link to it using this app runner service.
